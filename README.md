## Welcome to the Skeletal Observation Laboratory
At the Skeletal Observation Laboratory, we are dedicated to advancing the understanding of human joint mechanics to enhance health and mobility. Our research focuses on using biplanar videoradiography to capture precise, dynamic images of individual anatomies during high-demand activities. By integrating these detailed motion analyses with comprehensive musculoskeletal modeling, we aim to uncover insights into joint function and health.

## Our Mission
We strive to investigate the mechanical functions of joints during dynamic loading conditions.
Assess the impact of diseases and injuries on joint mechanics.
Evaluate the effectiveness of clinical interventions in restoring or enhancing joint function.
Through our research, we aim to contribute to treatments that promote longevity and quality of life by maintaining optimal musculoskeletal health.
